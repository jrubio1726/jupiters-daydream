            <h2>The First Step</h2>
              <p>
                My name is <em>Jupiter</em>, someone who probably spends far too much time daydreaming—living in a world I want to share with everyone. My desire to express myself through music began at my performing arts high school in my home of Houston, Texas. For over 8 years I have played guitar and have since branched out to playing the bass and seriously studying music theory and composition. I want to connect with people through something that has united human beings all throughout history: music. It is my hope that as a musician, composer and performer I can share with you my vision of a world where all are ignited by the joy and passion of creation. There's a world of creativity to be accessed through the technology of live-streaming and the ability to take what I stream and also upload it to a massive platform like YouTube is perfect for someone who wants to reach as many people as I possibly can. I want <strong>all</strong> to feel welcome in my community, whether you're here for..

          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Julian Rubio AKA <em>Jupiter, the Daydreamer</em> is a soon to be Loyola University graduate with a BA in Music Industry Studies. His journey in musicianship began in 2014 when he first picked up guitar lessons in middle school. Right then at 13, he was finally able to take the first step towards fulfilling one of the many daydreams that ignited his passion for music: being able to shred rock guitar with the greats. His desire to lay down an incredible solo with all the big hair bands was the gateway to developing a love for music theory, composing and performing as a whole. He later attended The High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in his hometown of Houston, Texas. He took his guitar and his desire to perform to the school's mariachi program and played in a mariachi band for 4 years. This allowed him to not only fight the stage fright that comes with being a performer but also open himself up to an entire genre of music that he would not have sought out himself. The irregular rhythmic patterns, the replacement of the half diminished seventh with the dominant 7 fifth and learning to sing in another language all actively play roles in the musician and composer Julian is today. Additionally, this knowledge fostered the desire to find different ways to teach music theory and even mathematics. The thought of certain people being completely turned off by a subject because it “didn't make sense” to them consistently motivates Julian to find ways to teach these subjects that are outside of the current binary. Being at Loyola has given Julian the opportunity to learn about what it takes to thrive in both the business scene of the music industry with classes like Venue Management and the music technology scene with classes like Recording Studio Techniques and Urban Music Production. He was able to take advantage of an opportunity to work as a stagehand at French Quarter for one of the smaller stages, which opened his eyes to the hard truth that the people around you aren't always going to hold your hand. Sometimes they'll look at you and say “figure it out,” leaving you only with the option to do just that. An internship Julian worked for well over 6 months helped him develop the skills necessary to market for local events and help run live non-profit events. Collaboration with multiple artists from Loyola on audio production projects has helped diversify Julian's skillset as far as creating records go. With these experiences under his belt he hopes to impress with a debut album in the works, one he has decided to call <em>“resent, evolve.”</em>
